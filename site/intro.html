          <b>Welcome to Layers!</b> You are a  6-12 grade teacher, and you will be focusing on a few specific students this semester, within your larger class. 
          Your job is to make an activity based on your chosen lesson topic, that will benefit each of the students that you select from the deck (2 to 3 students). While the lesson topics are important, your main focus should be to think of ways to support your chosen students. As the practice space progress, you will learn more and more information about these students that should inform your activity/lesson design.
          As you learn more about your students, you should think about how you might adjust a lesson plan for that day. </br>
          <b>Potential adaptations to your lesson plan can include: the way you explain the lesson topic itself, how long you allow the students to complete it, the extent to which students work individually or in pairs, or additional supports you may provide as a teacher.</b> </br> </br>

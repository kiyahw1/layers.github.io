            <b>Subject: </b>Earth Science </br>
            <b>Students: </b>Isabella Gomez, Orlando Ruiz, Tamika Thompson</br></br>
            <b>Layer 1: </b>Group based. Project based. Highly structured/clear instructions. </br>
            <b>Layer 2: </b>Study the health of the oceans and how to improve it. Hands-on/artistic, built-in choice, assign roles in the group. Learning menu - they get to choose the deliverable/the steps to get to the end result: Engineer something to raise awareness or something that is environmentally sustainable or friendly, visual representation of all of the trash that ends up in oceans to raise awareness, design a campaign to get people involved in solutions. List of information that has to be included: 8 facts about the oceans covered in class, 3 regions that are specifically targeted as high waste. Start with lectures on: the great Pacific garbage patch, overfishing, coral bleaching, use videos, engaging resources to draw their attention. Select one to explore further, templated research, oral presentation. </br>
            <b>Layer 3: </b>Oceans near El Salvador. Use technology. Have plenty of opportunities for work in class, but creating opportunities for Isabella to engage through technology (or include a division of labor so that if she isn’t there, she still has a contribution). Peer response/feedback for each presentation. Keeping it open artistically for what they want to do.</br></br>
            <b>Reflect 1: </b>Creating a lesson plan that is responsive to a student identity and unseen background that could impact their school performance. Adjusting based off of new revelations/new knowledge.</br>
            <b>Reflect 2: </b>First layer is really basic information that you would know right away. All is helpful - it all needs to be brought in for teaching the whole child. Layer two was when we really started to be able to think about the students as individuals/their needs. Layer 3 is very helpful (gives a lot of behind the scenes perspective about the kid), but it would be hard to accommodate at that level for the whole class.</br>
